## Project development continues on [github](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll). This page is kept for historical reason, please update to [the latest version](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) for better performance. ##

The overflow:scroll for mobile webkit. Project started because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size (width/height) div. So basically it was impossible to have a fixed header/footer and a scrolling central area. Until now.

Go to [project page](http://cubiq.org/iscroll) for details, watch a quick [screencast](http://vimeo.com/12459719).
